## 👥 **3. User Personas**

| Persona | Description | Goals | Pain Points |
|----------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| **The Organizer** | Regularly creates events and manages participants. | Quickly set up and share events, manage attendees, and get confirmations. | Manual coordination and message overload. |
| **The Attendee** | Participates in events and wants easy communication. | Discover and join events easily, receive clear updates. | Clunky signup flows, lack of timely notifications. |
| **The Explorer** | Browses for events nearby or trending. | Discover interesting meetups and join spontaneously. | Overwhelmed by irrelevant listings or complex UIs. |

---

## 🧱 **5. Information Architecture**

**High-level structure:**

```
/ (Landing Page)
├── /login
├── /signup
├── /events
│ ├── /create
│ ├── /:eventId
│ └── /edit/:eventId
├── /profile
│ ├── /settings
│ └── /preferences
└── /legal
├── /privacy-policy
└── /terms-of-service
```


Each page uses the **LandingPageLayout** or **AuthLayout** template for consistency.
Navigation uses a responsive `Navigation` organism with adaptive links and user state awareness.

---

## 🧩 **6. Component Design System**

### Core Atoms
- **Button** — primary, secondary, ghost
- **Input/Textarea** — with validation and ARIA support
- **Modal** — for confirmations and forms
- **Avatar** — displays user initials or uploaded image
- **Icons** — Lucide icons, consistent stroke width

### Molecules
- **Email Login/Signup Forms**
- **Toast Notifications** (using `sonner`)
- **Invite Friend Section**
- **Account Controls** (logout, password reset)

### Organisms
- **Navigation Bar** (responsive, auth-aware)
- **Hero Section** (scroll-into-view via React refs)
- **Footer** (supports `href` or `targetId`)
- **Event Cards** (status badges, participant count)

### Templates
- **LandingPageLayout**
- **AuthLayout**
- **DashboardLayout** (for future event management)

### Pages
- Home
- Event Detail
- Profile
- Terms / Privacy
- NotFound

## 🎨 **7. Visual Design**

**Typography:**
- Font: `Inter` (Sans-serif)
- Sizes: `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`, `text-2xl`
- Headings use `font-semibold`, tight line height for clarity

**Color Palette:**
| Role | Color | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Primary | `#3B82F6` | Action, links, positive states |
| Secondary | `#9333EA` | Highlights, icons |
| Background | `#FFFFFF` / `#0F172A` | Light / Dark modes |
| Success | `#16A34A` | Confirmations |
| Error | `#DC2626` | Validation errors |

**Layout & Spacing:**
- 8px base grid (Tailwind spacing scale)
- Max content width: `1280px`
- Generous padding for mobile usability

**Imagery:**
- Minimal illustrations, soft gradients, light tone
- Icons for function, not decoration

---

## ♿ **8. Accessibility & UX**

Pair Up Events is designed to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance.

✅ Implemented accessibility features:
- `aria-label`, `aria-live`, and `aria-invalid` attributes
- Focus management in modals and navigation
- Skip link component for keyboard navigation
- `useAccessibility` hook for focus traps and announcements
- Screen-reader-friendly toast notifications (`role="alert"`)
- Proper color contrast verified with tooling

Accessibility is reviewed monthly and tested with `@testing-library/jest-axe`.

---

## 📱 **9. Responsive Design**

**Approach:**
Mobile-first layouts that gracefully expand to tablet and desktop.

| Breakpoint | Width | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `sm` | 640px | Mobile |
| `md` | 768px | Tablet |
| `lg` | 1024px | Desktop |
| `xl` | 1280px | Large desktop |

**Responsive Patterns:**
- Hamburger navigation for mobile
- Collapsible sidebars
- Stacked forms and cards
- Adaptive grid with auto-fit columns

---

## ✨ **10. Animations & Micro-interactions**

- **Page transitions:** `framer-motion` fade + slide-in effects
- **Button feedback:** subtle scale + shadow on press
- **Toast notifications:** smooth entrance / exit animations
- **Hero section:** scroll-triggered fade-in
- **Error boundaries:** animated recovery prompt

**Philosophy:**
Use motion to reinforce state changes, not distract.
Animations should enhance comprehension and delight without slowing performance.

---

## 🎨 **11. Design Tokens & Theming**

- **Colors:** defined in `tailwind.config.ts` via custom palette
- **Typography:** configured in global styles (`index.css`)
- **Spacing units:** multiples of 4 for visual consistency
- **Dark Mode:** toggled via `data-theme="dark"` and persisted in localStorage

Example:
```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #3b82f6;
  --color-secondary: #9333ea;
}
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --color-primary: #60a5fa;
  --color-background: #0f172a;
}
```

## 💎 **12. Branding Guidelines**

### 🎭 Tone & Voice
Pair Up Events speaks with **warmth, energy, and inclusivity**.
We want users to feel like they’re part of something active and welcoming — a social brand built around real-world connection.

**Voice Attributes:**
- Friendly, conversational, and human
- Confident but never corporate
- Encouraging rather than directive
- Honest and transparent about privacy and safety

**Examples:**
- ✅ “Let’s make something fun happen.”
- ✅ “Invite your friends — they’ll love it.”
- ❌ “Submit your request to organize an event.”

### 🖋️ Logo Usage

**Primary Logo:**
- The full “Pair Up Events” logotype with icon.
- Preferred placement: top-left corner of navigation bar.
- Clear space: maintain padding equal to the logo height on all sides.
- Minimum size: 24px height for mobile, 40px for desktop.

**Variants:**
- **Light Mode:** Use the colored logo.
- **Dark Mode:** Use the white or monochrome variant.
- **Icon-only:** Use only the mark (without text) for compact spaces, favicons, or app icons.

**File Formats:**
SVG preferred for web. PNG for fallbacks.

### 🧭 Color Usage

| Color | Hex | Purpose |
|--------|-----|----------|
| Primary | `#3B82F6` | Action buttons, links |
| Secondary | `#9333EA` | Highlights, decorative accents |
| Accent | `#FBBF24` | Toasts, interactive highlights |
| Background | `#FFFFFF` / `#0F172A` | Light / Dark mode backgrounds |
| Neutral | `#F3F4F6` | Card backgrounds, surfaces |
| Success | `#16A34A` | Confirmations and positive messages |

> Always maintain **4.5:1 contrast ratio** for text and interactive elements.

### 🧩 Iconography

- Icon set: **Lucide** (outline-based)
- Stroke width: consistent `1.5px`
- Style: rounded corners, open shapes, minimal fills
- Size range: 16–32px depending on context
- Icons should **enhance meaning**, not decorate

---

### 🖼️ Imagery & Illustration

- **Style:** Minimal, bright, and people-centric
- **Tone:** Optimistic, approachable, authentic
- **Subjects:** Small social groups, casual gatherings, relatable real-life settings
- **Illustrations:** Use sparingly for onboarding, empty states, or legal pages
- **Avoid:** Overly corporate stock photos or abstract 3D renders

---

### 💬 Copywriting Guidelines

- Keep sentences short and actionable.
- Use **you/we** language — speak directly to the user.
- Prefer verbs over nouns (“Join an event” instead of “Event participation”).
- Always end critical actions (delete, logout) with confirmation feedback (toast).

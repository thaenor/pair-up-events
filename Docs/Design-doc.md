# 🚀 **1. Product Overview**
Pair Up Events is a social event platform that allows two pairs of people to connect and meet through shared activities.
Each "pair" represents two users who join the platform together (friends, couple, family duo, etc.).
The core system enables users to create, share, and join events, encouraging real-world interaction through fun, curiosity-driven activities.

**Goal:**
The goal of Pair Up Events is to facilitate real-world social connections by matching pairs of users who want to attend or host events together.

Functional objectives:

Enable users to create, browse, and join events with minimal friction.

Connect two pairs based on shared interests, location, and availability.

Encourage activity-based, non-romantic interactions.

Support event discovery, lightweight in-app messaging, and invitations in one unified experience.

Provide a mobile-first, responsive platform emphasizing usability and clarity.

Outcome goal:
Increase the number of meaningful real-world interactions by matching pairs for curated or user-created activities.

**Key Differentiator:**
2-Meets-2 Model

Core matching logic connects two pairs (2x2) instead of individuals or large groups.

This structure creates more comfortable and balanced social encounters.

Reduces awkwardness and encourages natural group conversation.

User-Driven Event Creation

Users can choose from platform-recommended events (based on interest tags) or create their own custom events.

Event creators define activity type, location, date/time, and capacity (2 pairs).

Excitement and Exploration Focus

The system promotes events that encourage learning, discovery, movement, or play.

No dating or networking focus — only curiosity-driven social engagement.

Inclusive Pair Types

Supported pair types:

Friends

Couples

Family pairs (parent-child, siblings, twins, etc.)

Roommates or colleagues

Matching logic remains pair-based, not individual-based.

**Target Users:**
| User Segment                    | Description                                          | Motivation                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Young Professionals (20–35)** | People seeking new experiences outside their routine | Fun, novelty, social discovery      |
| **Friends or Couples**          | Duos looking to meet others with similar energy      | Shared adventures, mutual interests |
| **Expats & Newcomers**          | People integrating into a new city or culture        | Authentic, local experiences        |
| **Families & Themed Pairs**     | Parent-child, siblings, twins, etc.                  | Playful learning and shared bonding |
| **Activity Enthusiasts**        | Users who enjoy active, experiential socializing     | Real-world engagement               |

## 🤝 Pair Up Events — Primary Use Cases

Pair Up Events is a web platform that connects two pairs (duos) of people to attend events or experiences together.  
The core user experience is centered around **exploring**, **creating**, **joining**, and **chatting** around shared experiences.  
There are no individual participants — every confirmed event involves **two duos (four people total)**.

---

## 👥 User Roles

| Label | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **User A** | Creator of a new event or experience. Starts the process by choosing an activity idea, location, and date. |
| **User B** | The first invited user who joins User A’s event to form a confirmed duo. |
| **User C** | A user who discovers a live event (created by A + B) through the Explore page and decides to join it with their own duo. |
| **User D** | The partner of User C — confirms participation, finalizing the group of four. |

Each confirmed event = **1 Duo (A+B)** + **1 Duo (C+D)**.

---

## 🧩 Primary Use Cases

### **Use Case 1 — Explore Experiences**
- Users (logged-in or logged-out) browse activity cards in their city.
- Two types of cards exist:
  1. **Default PairUp Templates** → inspire users to create a new event.
  2. **User-Created Events** → represent real events by existing duos.
- Logged-out users see blurred date and location details and are prompted to sign up.

**Goal:** Inspire new sign-ups and encourage event creation.

---

### **Use Case 2 — Create an Event (User A Flow)**
1. User A chooses a default template or starts from scratch.
2. Completes event form (activity, date, city, vibe, etc.).
3. Invites a partner (User B) via a unique link.
4. Event appears in **Pending** state until User B accepts.
5. Once User B confirms → Event becomes **Live** and visible in Explore.

**Goal:** Enable User A to easily create an activity and form a duo.

---

### **Use Case 3 — Join an Event as Duo (User C + D Flow)**
1. User C discovers a live event (A+B) in Explore.
2. Sends a “Join Request” for their duo.
3. Invites their own partner (User D) via link.
4. First User D to accept → pair is locked (C+D confirmed).
5. A+B receive a notification to accept or decline.
6. Once approved → event becomes confirmed and visible to all 4 participants.

**Goal:** Allow new duos to join live experiences and form complete event groups.

---

### **Use Case 4 — Event Confirmation and Group Chat**
- When both duos (A+B and C+D) are confirmed, a **group chat** is automatically created.
- All four participants can communicate to plan details.
- Chat includes a built-in **report** feature for users or events.

**Goal:** Facilitate safe, easy coordination and connection between participants.

---

### **Use Case 5 — Event Completion and Feedback**
- After the event date passes:
  - System prompts all participants to rate the other duo and leave feedback.
  - Message displayed in chat:

    > “Hope you had a great experience! 🌟  
    > You can rate the other duo and leave a short comment.  
    > Want to keep this chat open or archive it? Archived chats will be muted.”

- Users can **keep** or **archive** chats:
  - Archived chats move under “Past Events” (collapsible section).
  - Notifications muted but chat remains accessible.
  - Chats can be reopened at any time.

**Goal:** Close the loop after the event, collect feedback, and maintain a positive post-event experience.

---

### **Use Case 6 — Automatic Chat Lifecycle**
- Chats inactive for **30 days** automatically move to “Archived.”
- This keeps the chat list clean while preserving history.
- Users can reopen archived chats at any time.

**Goal:** Maintain a tidy interface and support natural social rhythm.

---

### **Use Case 7 — Reporting and Moderation**
- Users can report:
  - An event  
  - Another user  
- Accessible from:
  - Direct chat
  - Event detail page
  - User profile
- Reports include category selection (harassment, spam, etc.) and optional comments.
- Reports are sent to the moderation system for internal review.

**Goal:** Provide safety, trust, and accountability across all interactions.

---

### **Use Case 8 — Notifications**
Triggered across web and email:
- Event invites (B and D)
- Join requests (A+B)
- Confirmations, acceptances, declines
- Event reminders (24h before)
- Chat messages
- Feedback prompts (after event)
- System updates (cancellations, reports)

**Goal:** Keep users informed about event progress and communication updates.

---

### **Use Case 9 — Profile and Settings**
- Users manage profile info, language, and privacy preferences.
- Access support, guides, and feedback.
- Log out and data privacy options included.

**Goal:** Provide users control, personalization, and transparency.

---

They’re eager to meet locals through authentic, low-pressure experiences. | Carlos (27, architect) & Diego (28, product designer) | - Meet locals naturally.<br>- Explore the city through shared activities.<br>- Build a genuine, lasting social circle. | - Cultural and language barriers make meeting people hard.<br>- Local event options feel impersonal or untrustworthy.<br>- Fear of attending large or mismatched events. |

## 🎨 **7. Visual Design**

**Typography:**
- Font: `Inter` (Sans-serif)
- Sizes: `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`, `text-2xl`
- Headings use `font-semibold`, tight line height for clarity

**Color Palette:**
| Role | Color | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Primary | `#3B82F6` | Action, links, positive states |
| Secondary | `#9333EA` | Highlights, icons |
| Background | `#FFFFFF` / `#0F172A` | Light / Dark modes |
| Success | `#16A34A` | Confirmations |
| Error | `#DC2626` | Validation errors |

**Layout & Spacing:**
- 8px base grid (Tailwind spacing scale)
- Max content width: `1280px`
- Generous padding for mobile usability

**Imagery:**
- Minimal illustrations, soft gradients, light tone
- Icons for function, not decoration

---

## ♿ **8. Accessibility & UX**

Pair Up Events is designed to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance.

✅ Implemented accessibility features:
- `aria-label`, `aria-live`, and `aria-invalid` attributes
- Focus management in modals and navigation
- Skip link component for keyboard navigation
- `useAccessibility` hook for focus traps and announcements
- Screen-reader-friendly toast notifications (`role="alert"`)
- Proper color contrast verified with tooling

Accessibility is reviewed monthly and tested with `@testing-library/jest-axe`.

---

## 📱 **9. Responsive Design**

**Approach:**
Mobile-first layouts that gracefully expand to tablet and desktop.

| Breakpoint | Width | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `sm` | 640px | Mobile |
| `md` | 768px | Tablet |
| `lg` | 1024px | Desktop |
| `xl` | 1280px | Large desktop |

**Responsive Patterns:**
- Hamburger navigation for mobile
- Collapsible sidebars
- Stacked forms and cards
- Adaptive grid with auto-fit columns

---

## ✨ **10. Animations & Micro-interactions**

- **Page transitions:** `framer-motion` fade + slide-in effects
- **Button feedback:** subtle scale + shadow on press
- **Toast notifications:** smooth entrance / exit animations
- **Hero section:** scroll-triggered fade-in
- **Error boundaries:** animated recovery prompt

**Philosophy:**
Use motion to reinforce state changes, not distract.
Animations should enhance comprehension and delight without slowing performance.

---

## 🎨 **11. Design Tokens & Theming**

## 💎 **12. Branding Guidelines**

### 🎭 Tone & Voice
Pair Up Events speaks with **warmth, energy, and inclusivity**.
We want users to feel like they’re part of something active and welcoming — a social brand built around real-world connection.

**Voice Attributes:**
- Friendly, conversational, and human
- Confident but never corporate
- Encouraging rather than directive
- Honest and transparent about privacy and safety

**Examples:**
- ✅ “Let’s make something fun happen.”
- ✅ “Invite your friends — they’ll love it.”
- ❌ “Submit your request to organize an event.”

### 🖋️ Logo Usage

**Primary Logo:**
- The full “Pair Up Events” logotype with icon.
- Preferred placement: top-left corner of navigation bar.
- Clear space: maintain padding equal to the logo height on all sides.
- Minimum size: 24px height for mobile, 40px for desktop.

**Variants:**
- **Light Mode:** Use the colored logo.
- **Dark Mode:** Use the white or monochrome variant.
- **Icon-only:** Use only the mark (without text) for compact spaces, favicons, or app icons.

**File Formats:**
SVG preferred for web. PNG for fallbacks.

- Always end critical actions (delete, logout) with confirmation feedback (toast).

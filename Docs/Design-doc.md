## üöÄ **1. Product Overview**
Pair Up Events is a social event platform that allows two pairs of people to connect and meet through shared activities.
Each "pair" represents two users who join the platform together (friends, couple, family duo, etc.).
The core system enables users to create, share, and join events, encouraging real-world interaction through fun, curiosity-driven activities.

**Goal:**
The goal of Pair Up Events is to facilitate real-world social connections by matching pairs of users who want to attend or host events together.

Functional objectives:

Enable users to create, browse, and join events with minimal friction.

Connect two pairs based on shared interests, location, and availability.

Encourage activity-based, non-romantic interactions.

Support event discovery, lightweight in-app messaging, and invitations in one unified experience.

Provide a mobile-first, responsive platform emphasizing usability and clarity.

Outcome goal:
Increase the number of meaningful real-world interactions by matching pairs for curated or user-created activities.

**Key Differentiator:**
2-Meets-2 Model

Core matching logic connects two pairs (2x2) instead of individuals or large groups.

This structure creates more comfortable and balanced social encounters.

Reduces awkwardness and encourages natural group conversation.

User-Driven Event Creation

Users can choose from platform-recommended events (based on interest tags) or create their own custom events.

Event creators define activity type, location, date/time, and capacity (2 pairs).

Excitement and Exploration Focus

The system promotes events that encourage learning, discovery, movement, or play.

No dating or networking focus ‚Äî only curiosity-driven social engagement.

Inclusive Pair Types

Supported pair types:

Friends

Couples

Family pairs (parent-child, siblings, twins, etc.)

Roommates or colleagues

Matching logic remains pair-based, not individual-based.

- [ ] Configure domain restrictions in Firebase
- [ ] Set up CSP headers in hosting configuration

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Verify Sentry integration
- [ ] Configure analytics (GTM/GA4)
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Enable error alerting

### 4. Deploy
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Check accessibility with browser tools

2. Check recent changes in git history
3. Revert to previous stable version
4. Investigate root cause
5. Fix and redeploy

### Rollback Command
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or rollback in hosting platform UI
```

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (All Met ✅)
- [x] Zero critical errors
